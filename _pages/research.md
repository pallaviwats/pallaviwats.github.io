**Outsourcing Talent: Inside the High-Skilled Immigration Market**
<br>
In the U.S., firms hire high-skilled immigrants through the H-1B visa program, which allocates a fixed number of visas annually via lottery. This capped, lottery-based structure limits firmsâ€™ direct access to foreign talent, leading many to rely on outsourcing firms that subcontract H-1B workers to them. Outsourcing firms currently receive roughly half of all new H-1B visas. Previous studies find that high-skilled immigrants improve firm outcomes such as innovation, domestic employment and wages, and investment, How do outsourcing firms affect these gains? On the one hand, outsourcing firms could facilitate a more efficient matching of workers and jobs and help productive firms expand beyond the lottery cap. On the other hand, outsourcing firms could primarily serve to extract rents and thereby reduce efficiency. In this paper, I study the welfare implications of outsourcing firms acting as intermediaries in the U.S. H-1B labor market.
