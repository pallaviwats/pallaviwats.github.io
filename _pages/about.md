I am a **third-year PhD Student in Economics** at [University of Virginia](https://economics.virginia.edu). My research interests are in labor economics and indusrtrial organization. 

Before my PhD, I was a pre-doc at Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM A), focusing on health economics and political economy. I hold a BA (Honours) in Economics from Miranda House, University of Delhi.
